# Zarhus OS on CROSSCON Hypervisor on RPi 4

This guide provides info on how to boot Zarhus OS on a Raspberry Pi 4 device
running the
[CROSSCON Hypervisor](https://github.com/crosscon/CROSSCON-Hypervisor).

## Build CROSSCON Hypervisor

First, follow the
[default demo](https://github.com/crosscon/CROSSCON-Hypervisor-and-TEE-Isolation-Demos/blob/67eb25c97dda2457ca08fa1a10ea68c9c6095b05/rpi4-ws/README.md)
using the
[docker environment](https://github.com/crosscon/CROSSCON-Hypervisor-and-TEE-Isolation-Demos/blob/b437f7ecfe2a24bed6219e805ad0133882b832f4/env/README.md)
to isolate the dependencies.
Make sure to save the content of the prepared boot partition, so that
it will not be lost, as it will be needed later.

## Build Zarhus

Zarhus OS will also have to be built (on the host).
Make sure to run this exact build command:

```bash
SHELL=/bin/bash KAS_MACHINE=raspberrypi4-64 kas-container build meta-zarhus/kas/common.yml:meta-zarhus/kas/cache.yml:meta-zarhus/kas/debug.yml:meta-zarhus/kas/rpi.yml
```

!!! note

    The `KAS_MACHINE` variable is significant, `raspberrypi4` would build a
    32-bit version of the system - `raspberrypi4-64` needs to be used in order
    to get a 64-bit version, so that it's compatible with the hypervisor.

## Replacing kernel

When the Zarhus OS build finishes, flash the SD card:

```bash
cd build/tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi4-64/
sudo bmaptool copy --bmap zarhus-base-image-debug-raspberrypi4-64.rootfs.wic.bmap zarhus-base-image-debug-raspberrypi4-64.rootfs.wic.gz /dev/sd[X]
```

!!! note
    Replace `/dev/sd[X]` with the actual card.

Once that finishes, remount the card and delete everything from the `/boot`
partition, replacing it with the content produced by the CROSSCON Hypervisor
demo step above.

The kernel from the CROSSCON demo also needs to be swapped with the Zarhus OS
kernel. It can be done by first copying the new kernel to the container (make
sure to copy the actual kernel, not the symlink):

```bash
cd build/tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi4-64/
docker cp -L Image crosscon_hv_container:/work/Image
```

!!! note

    `-L` argument is needed to copy underlying file instead of symlink

## The final image

The Hypervisor will have to be recompiled, starting from
[step 9](https://github.com/crosscon/CROSSCON-Hypervisor-and-TEE-Isolation-Demos/blob/67eb25c97dda2457ca08fa1a10ea68c9c6095b05/rpi4-ws/README.md#step-9-bind-linux-image-and-device-tree)
of the original demo.

First apply this change to the device tree file in `rpi4-ws` folder (make
sure this is done inside the container):

!!! note

    This `git diff` was put here in order to outline the changes that
    need to be made to the `rpi4.dts` file. It can work as a patch to be
    applied, but if it doesn't apply, installing some sort of text editor
    on the container in order to apply the changes manually will be necessary:
    ```bash
    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade
    apt-get install vim nano
    ```

The reasoning for these changes is as follows:

* `8250.nr_uarts=8` tells the `8250` serial driver to allocate up to 8 serial
ports. This is necessary, because if this line is not here, logs from OS level
will not show up on the console.
* `root=/dev/mmcblk1p2` tells the kernel that there is a `/root` partition
at that location. By default, the CROSSCON Hypervisor doesn't have a `rootfs`
or a partition for it, so this has to be added.
* `rw` ensures that the `rootfs` gets mounted in `read-write` mode, rather
than `read-only`.
* `rootwait` tells the kernel to wait until the root device (in this case,
`/dev/mmcblk1p2`) is detected and available before trying to mount it. There
can be a delay when enumerating the storage device, so this stops the kernel
from giving up too early.
* `console=ttyS1,115200` sets the right console, this enables access to the
console and logs from OS level.
* setting `status = "disabled"` for the Bluetooth driver, while technically not
necessary, is a good practice as it can disrupt the serial console setup.
* Finally, setting the `dma-ranges` and `status="okay"` for the `emmc2bus`
enables the whole SD card storage device.

Then run the following commands:

```bash
root@565810a48049:/# cd /work/crosscon
root@565810a48049:/work/crosscon# dtc -I dts -O dtb rpi4-ws/rpi4.dts > rpi4-ws/rpi4.dtb
root@565810a48049:/work/crosscon# cd lloader
root@565810a48049:/work/crosscon/lloader# rm linux-rpi4.bin
root@565810a48049:/work/crosscon/lloader# rm linux-rpi4.elf
root@565810a48049:/work/crosscon/lloader# make  \
    IMAGE=/work/Image \
    DTB=../rpi4-ws/rpi4.dtb \
    TARGET=linux-rpi4.bin \
    CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-none-elf- \
    ARCH=aarch64
```

Notice that this step has changed, so instead of using the kernel
from `linux/build-aarch64/arch/arm64/boot/`, the kernel from
the Yocto deploy directory is used.

Now the CROSSCON Hypervisor is almost ready to be built - just one more change
needs to be applied:

```git
root@565810a48049:/work/crosscon/CROSSCON-Hypervisor# git diff src/arch/armv8/aborts.c
diff --git a/src/arch/armv8/aborts.c b/src/arch/armv8/aborts.c

     }

```

!!! note

    Again, just like in the above `git diff`, a text editor might be
    necessary to use in order to apply this change.

This additional `printk` keeps the UART output going, so that the console can
be accessed. `\x9D` is unprintable character and is used so it doesn't pollute
serial output. It mostly works (sometimes you can see cursor changing position).
Right now, according to
[this issue](https://github.com/crosscon/CROSSCON-Hypervisor-and-TEE-Isolation-Demos/issues/8#issuecomment-2702293550)
this is the only workaround.

Now the commands needed to build the Hypervisor can be re-ran:

```bash
root@565810a48049:/# CONFIG_REPO=/work/crosscon/rpi4-ws/configs
root@565810a48049:/# cd /work/crosscon

root@565810a48049:/work/crosscon# make -C CROSSCON-Hypervisor/ \
	PLATFORM=rpi4 \
	CONFIG_BUILTIN=y \
	CONFIG_REPO=$CONFIG_REPO \
	CONFIG=rpi4-single-vTEE \
	OPTIMIZATIONS=0 \
        SDEES="sdSGX sdTZ" \
	CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-none-elf- \
        clean

root@565810a48049:/work/crosscon# make -C CROSSCON-Hypervisor/ \
	PLATFORM=rpi4 \
	CONFIG_BUILTIN=y \
	CONFIG_REPO=$CONFIG_REPO \
	CONFIG=rpi4-single-vTEE \
	OPTIMIZATIONS=0 \
        SDEES="sdSGX sdTZ" \
	CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-none-elf- \
        -j`nproc`
```

After executing these commands, the binary will be at the following path on the
container:

```bash
root@565810a48049:/work/crosscon# realpath CROSSCON-Hypervisor/bin/rpi4/builtin-configs/rpi4-single-vTEE/crossconhyp.bin
/work/crosscon/CROSSCON-Hypervisor/bin/rpi4/builtin-configs/rpi4-single-vTEE/crossconhyp.bin
root@565810a48049:/work/crosscon#
```

The second-to-last step is to copy it over to host, then onto the SD card:

```bash
docker cp crosscon_hv_container:/work/crosscon/CROSSCON-Hypervisor/bin/rpi4/builtin-configs/rpi4-single-vTEE/crossconhyp.bin .
cp crossconhyp.bin /run/media/$USER/boot/
```

!!! note

    The SD card doesn't necessarily have to be mounted at
    `/run/media/$USER/boot`, so make sure to check where it's actually mounted
    by using `lsblk` and checking the location.

And finally the second partition (the one containing the rootfs) has to be
mounted. This is necessary in order to edit the `/etc/fstab` file, which tells
the kernel where the `/boot` partition is.

Once the second partition has been mounted, make sure the `/etc/fstab` file
looks exactly like this (this command assumes that the second partition
has been manually mounted using `mount` at `/mnt` directory):

```bash
user in ~ Î» cat /mnt/etc/fstab
# stock fstab - you probably want to override this with a machine specific one

/dev/root            /                    auto       defaults              1  1
proc                 /proc                proc       defaults              0  0
devpts               /dev/pts             devpts     mode=0620,ptmxmode=0666,gid=5      0  0
tmpfs                /run                 tmpfs      mode=0755,nodev,nosuid,strictatime 0  0
tmpfs                /var/volatile        tmpfs      defaults              0  0

# uncomment this if your device has a SD/MMC/Transflash slot
#/dev/mmcblk0p1       /media/card          auto       defaults,sync,noauto  0  0

/dev/mmcblk1p1	/boot	vfat	defaults	0	0
user in ~ Î»
```

By default, `/boot` is specified for `/dev/mmcblk0p1`, which works for the
purpose of using Zarhus OS without the CROSSCON Hypervisor, but in this case
it has to be edited to point to the correct partition, which is
`/dev/mmcblk1p1`

The final setup for connections and booting is the same as in the
[last steps of the Hypervisor demo](https://github.com/crosscon/CROSSCON-Hypervisor-and-TEE-Isolation-Demos/blob/67eb25c97dda2457ca08fa1a10ea68c9c6095b05/rpi4-ws/README.md#setup-board).
