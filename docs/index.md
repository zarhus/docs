# Welcome to the world of Zarhus - Your Digital Chess Knight üëã

Inspired by the elegance and strategic prowess of the "husz√°r", meaning knight
in chess (Polish: skoczek), Zarhus brings a unique blend of tradition and
innovation to your embedded systems experience.

## üß≠ Mission and Vision

Zarhus is an embedded Linux distribution developed by 3mdeb, based on the Yocto
Project. It simplifies the provisioning, integration, and maintenance of
embedded platforms, with a strong focus on leveraging Root of Trust and Chain of
Trust Technologies. This ensures that our clients' applications can be securely
and reliably deployed.

### Mission

* Host vMeetups and face-to-face training conferences to boost knowledge of
  embedded systems booting and security.
* Navigate through growing complexity of boot chain of modern computing.
* Simplifying hardware security enablement.

### Vision

* Systems become secure, trustworthy, and repairable.
* Modern tools enhance creativity and collaboration without replacing human
  purpose.
* Communities can thrive with technology that respects freedom, simplicity, and
  sovereignty.

### Strategy

* Extend core firmware components (U-Boot, ARM Trusted Firmware, Linux Kernel)
  toward a fully open, reproducible, and auditable Root and Chain of Trust.
* Integrate cutting-edge hardware security building blocks (secure storage,
  secure elements, embedded dTPM solutions, OP-TEE-based firmware TPM, encrypted
  root filesystems) to ensure measurable integrity and resilience.
* Develop tooling for Root of Trust (RoT) and Chain of Trust (CoT) with
  long-term maintainability in mind.
* Collaboratively participate in communities aligned with freedom, sovereignty,
  and simplicity‚Äîparticularly those around Dasharo, OpenXT, Qubes OS,
  Kicksecure, FreeBSD, OpenWRT, Debian, Fedora, and similar technology
  ecosystems.
* Adopt an iterative, demo-driven approach to project execution, continuously
  communicating progress through derivative products that demonstrate real-world
  applicability and validate ideas in practical scenarios.
* Project progress reporting using derivative products and demo-driven approach.
