# Welcome to Zarhus

**Zarhus** is an  embedded Linux distribution developed by
[3mdeb](https://3mdeb.com), built on top of the [Yocto
Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/). It simplifies provisioning,
integration, and maintenance of embedded platforms placing security at its core
with strong emphasis on **Root of Trust** (RoT) and **Chain of Trust** (CoT)
technologies. Our goal is to ensure embedded applications are deployed in
trustworthy way.

---

## 🎯 Mission

* Host **vMeetups** and hands-on training to empower developers with knowledge
of secure boot and embedded systems.
* Help users navigate the growing complexity of modern boot chains.
* Simplify hardware security enablement in a reproducible and transparent way.

---

## 🌅 Vision

We envision a world where:

* Systems are **secure**, **trustworthy**, and **repairable**.
* Tools enhance **creativity** and **collaboration** without diminishing human
purpose.
* Communities thrive through technology that respects **freedom**,
**simplicity**, and **digital sovereignty**.

---

## 🛠️ Strategy

To achieve this vision, Zarhus:

* Extends core firmware components like **U-Boot**, **ARM Trusted Firmware**,
and the **Linux Kernel** to build an auditable and reproducible Root and Chain
of Trust.
* Integrates advanced hardware security features: secure storage, secure
elements, embedded TPMs (e.g., OP-TEE TPMs), encrypted root filesystems, and
more.
* Builds long-term maintainable tooling to support RoT and CoT.
* Actively collaborates with like-minded communities, such as Dasharo, OpenXT,
Qubes OS, Kicksecure, FreeBSD, OpenWRT, Debian, and Fedora.
* Follows a **demo-driven, iterative development approach**, emphasizing
real-world applicability and constant feedback.
* Regularly reports progress through working demos and derivative products.

## 🧩 What's in the Name?

The name **Zarhus** is an anagram of the Hungarian word _"huszár"_ a knight in
chess and a nod to the Polish **Husaria**, renowned heavy cavalry. It
symbolizes agility, strength, and strategy qualities we bring to embedded
system security.
